This repository contains my completed 2-hour technical assignment for the Data Engineer I position at Loomen.

The task was shared via PDF and included data engineering challenges designed to evaluate my ability to work with ETL processes, data transformation, and clear documentation. Although the assignment had a strict 2-hour time limit, I prioritized delivering a structured and well-documented solution that highlights my approach, logic, and technical skills.

The goal was not necessarily to complete everything, but to demonstrate my thought process, problem-solving ability, and how I organize and communicate my work.

Youâ€™ll find my code, documentation, and any assumptions or design decisions I made during the challenge.
